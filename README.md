### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My biggest project is a farm management tool which is agronomy targeted for bigger or smaller farms, It will have a tool for calculating how much time is left until a crop needs to be fertilized or when it can be harvested. I will try to partner this with Agco(https://agcocorp.com) and other farm equipment manufacturers. Meaning you will be able to install this to your equipment so you will be able to link your equipment to our website.

I'm a web developer inside of HTML, CSS and JS.

I have experience in Roblox Studio coding.

I have experience in 3D modeling in blender.

I'm management on https://tridentnodes.com

You can reach me on discord, EwweKovacevic#8504 or gmail, kovacevic.erwin@gmail.com
